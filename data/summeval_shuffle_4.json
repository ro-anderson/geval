    "source": "Cats and dogs have the advantage over marine pets in that they can interact with humans through the sense of touch . But that doesn ’ t prevent one man from dipping his hand in the fish tank and giving his blood parrot cichlid a stroke . Capturing his remarkable relationship on camera , Roland Giroux gently cups the fish with his hand from within side the tank and then treats it to a massage . The fish begins relaxing in the man 's hand and stays very still as the owner begins to stroke it with his finger The fish initially moves away before swimming in a full circle and returning to rest in between the man ’ s fingers . The man then begins massaging the pet by running his finger along it and the fish stays completely still as if enjoying the sensation . Repeating the process , the fish swims off once more before immediately returning to the man ’ s hand to be stroked again . Later in the video the fish interacts further with the man by swimming up his arm and circling his fingers . The man places his hand into the tank and gently cups the blood parrot cichlid with his fingers Before burying its face into his hand and remaining very still once more . The video concludes with the man removing his hand from the tank and the fish , clearly saddened by this , following it up to the surface of the water . According to Mr Giroux , who uploads many videos of his fish to his Youtube channel , the blood parrot cichlid used to share its tank with two other fish . The fish swims away from the man 's hand a few times in the video but returns to be massaged But he was forced to remove the other two from the tank when he noticed that they were bullying his prized pet . He then set about interacting with the fish by feeding it frozen blood worms by hand and eventually he noticed it becoming more sociable . After a while the fish enjoyed being stroked and Mr Giroux noted that it would become frustrated if he didn ’ t play with it on a daily basis . The fish begins swimming around the man 's fingers and towards the surface as he removes his hand The man massages and plays with his fish for at least 15 minutes each day . The blood parrot cichlid is a hybrid of the midas and the redhead cichlid and was first bred in Taiwan around 1986 .",

    "source": "Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has reminded Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe about their professional responsibilities and urged them to learn from a chastening week . Sterling , the England international who will lead Liverpool ’ s line at Wembley on Sunday in the absence of the injured Daniel Sturridge , was exposed for inhaling the legal high nitrous oxide on Monday . Then 24 hours later pictures emerged of Sterling and Ibe with shisha pipes .

He said : ‘ It is understanding that when you are a professional , elite sportsperson , there are things you can and can not be doing and be seen to be doing . ‘ It ’ s not just for your welfare but also because of your responsibilities . ‘ It is difficult . Some of these young guys are doing what you would consider to be normal things — and I ’ m not talking about this instance — ( but ) how it gets framed is totally different. ’ Rodgers would not discuss whether he would give Gerrard , available after a three-match suspension , an immediate recall against Villa , making it clear that his sole priority is steering Liverpool into their first FA Cup final of his reign . They fell short in the title race last season and then faltered in the last four of the Capital One Cup in January , but Rodgers thinks they are ready to progress . Reds have captain Steven Gerrard ( centre ) back for their FA Cup semi after serving a three-match suspension ‘ When you get so close , whether it was in the title race or the cup , it hurts , ’ said Rodgers . ‘ Trace back the winners in sport . If you look at everything they have won , also look at what they have lost . You will see that they go close on a number of occasions before they step on . ‘ Look at players who have won Champions Leagues and you trace back and see they have also lost Champions League semi-finals and finals . It ’ s all part of the journey — losing but taking that forward and improving you. ’ Rodgers ( left ) has n't revealed whether he 'll recall Gerrard for Sunday 's clash against Aston Villa at Wembley",

    "source": "( CNN ) ISIS on Wednesday released more than 200 Yazidis , a minority group whose members were killed , captured and displaced when the Islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern Iraq last summer , officials said . Most of those released were women and children ; the rest were ill or elderly , said Rassol Omar , a commander in the Peshmerga force that defends northern Iraq 's semi-autonomous Kurdish region . Omar did n't say what led to the release , other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it . The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga , who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital , Irbil , said Nuri Osman , an official with Iraq 's Kurdistan Regional Government . It was n't immediately clear what motivated Wednesday 's release , Osman said . Osman said 217 Yazidis were released . Omar , the Peshmerga commander , had a higher count : 228 . ISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group 's towns last year . The Sunni Islamist militant group steamrolled into Iraq 's north last summer , forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- Yazidis among them -- from their homes . Yazidis are of Kurdish descent , and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity , Judaism and Zoroastrianism . One of the oldest religious communities in the world , the Yazidis have long suffered persecution , with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshipers . ISIS ' cruelty to them has been extraordinary . ISIS ' conquest of the town of Sinjar , in particular , provoked a major humanitarian crisis as some Yazidis fled into the mountains -- where many became trapped for a time without food and water -- and others fled by foot into neighboring Syria . ISIS slaughtered Yazidis by the hundreds , Yian Dakhil , the only lawmaker representing the Yazidis in Iraq 's Parliament , told CNN last year . Reports emerged from some Yazidi survivors that ISIS raped and enslaved female Yazidi captives . An international coalition responded , first by airdropping supplies in the mountains . Rescues came next . And then , starting in August , the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria . The U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq , accounting for less than 1 % of the country 's population . CNN 's Raja Razek reported from Beirut . CNN 's Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta . CNN 's Hamdi Alkshali , Faith Karimi and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report .",
