Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n*** EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nConsistency (1-5) - the factual alignment between the actual output and the expected output. A factually consistent actual output contains only statements that are entailed by the expected output. Penalize any hallucinated or unsupported facts. Evaluation Steps: 1. Read the expected output carefully and identify the main facts and details it presents. 2. Read the actual output and compare it to the expected output. Check if the actual output contains any factual errors that are not supported by the expected output. 3. Assign a score for consistency based on the Evaluation Criteria.\n\nTo evaluate the consistency of the actual output compared to the expected output, follow these detailed steps to ensure a thorough and systematic assessment:\n\n### Evaluation Steps\n\n1. **Understand the Expected Output:**\n   - **Read Thoroughly:** Carefully read the expected output to fully understand the main facts, details, and context it presents. Pay attention to specific data points, statements, and any context provided.\n   - **Identify Key Facts:** List out the key facts and details that are essential to the expected output. This might include specific numbers, names, events, or relationships.\n\n2. **Analyze the Actual Output:**\n   - **Read Carefully:** Read the actual output attentively, ensuring you capture all the details and statements it provides.\n   - **Compare and Contrast:** Compare each statement in the actual output with the key facts identified from the expected output. Focus on whether each statement in the actual output is supported by, or directly derived from, the expected output.\n\n3. **Check for Consistency:**\n   - **Identify Supported Facts:** For each statement in the actual output, determine if it is factually supported by the expected output. Ensure that no additional facts are introduced that are not present or implied in the expected output.\n   - **Identify Unsupported or Hallucinated Facts:** Note any statements or details in the actual output that are not supported by the expected output. These are considered inconsistencies or hallucinations.\n\n4. **Assign a Score Based on Consistency:**\n   - **Scoring Criteria:**\n     - **Score 5:** The actual output is fully consistent with the expected output, with no unsupported or hallucinated facts.\n     - **Score 4:** The actual output is mostly consistent, with minor unsupported facts that do not significantly alter the overall meaning.\n     - **Score 3:** The actual output contains several unsupported facts, but they do not completely undermine the factual integrity.\n     - **Score 2:** The actual output has many unsupported facts, significantly affecting the factual consistency.\n     - **Score 1:** The actual output is largely inconsistent, with numerous unsupported or hallucinated facts that change the meaning or context.\n\n5. **Document the Reasoning:**\n   - **Provide Explanation:** Clearly document the reasoning for the score assigned, referencing specific examples of consistency or inconsistencies observed during the evaluation.\n\n6. **Return the Final Score:**\n   - **Ensure Score is an Integer:** Confirm that the final score is an integer and falls within the 1 to 5 range.\n   - **Submit the Score:** Provide the final score along with the documented reasoning as the evaluation output.\n\nBy following these steps, the evaluation process will be transparent, consistent, and aligned with the provided criteria for assessing factual consistency.\n\n*** INPUT:\nExpected Output:\n\nAn Oregon couple announced they are expecting a child in a rap video they made set to the theme from '90s television sitcom 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air .
