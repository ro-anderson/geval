Omar did n't say what led to the release , other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it . The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga , who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital , Irbil , said Nuri Osman , an official with Iraq 's Kurdistan Regional Government .

In the Meeks ' parody video , Melissa raps , 'When our family and friends , who were up to no good , started asking questions about parenthood . 'We told one little lie , said `` It 's not time yet . '' Parents said `` We 're ready for grandkids , get a move on it ! '' ' Jesse raps that the couple thought it would take longer than the two months the pair spent trying to conceive . Melissa says in the video ' I woke up in the morning about 7 or 8 and I thought to myself , `` Oh man , I 'm late ! '' Looked at the test and it was finally there . The little plus sign . We 're now three . Not a pair . ' At the end of the video , the Meeks smile and share a sonogram of their unborn child . It took five takes to film the clip , the couple told KPTV .

        "source": "An FBI agent 's sniper rifle ( similar to the one pictured ) was ripped out of his car 's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot An FBI agent 's sniper rifle was ripped out of his car 's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot just days before President Obama visited Utah earlier this month . The gun was inside a hard rifle case and was 'secured properly ' to a truck safe with padlocks and chains while the car was parked at the Marriott Springhill Suites , according to police . Police believe the thief stole the rifle by breaking the rear right passenger-side window , tying a rope around the rifle case 's handle or a cable lock , and using the momentum from another vehicle to then break the case 's handle free from the lock . The window frame of the agent 's car was pulled from the door , which police believe could indicate the large case was ripped through the shattered window . 'The rifle had been secured properly , ' Salt Lake City Police Detective Dennis McGowan told Fox 13 Salt Lake City . 'There are all kinds of ways the weapon was secure .

        "source": "( CNN ) Donald Sterling 's racist remarks cost him an NBA team last year . But now it 's his former female companion who has lost big . A Los Angeles judge has ordered V. Stiviano to pay back more than $ 2.6 million in gifts after Sterling 's wife sued her . In the lawsuit , Rochelle `` Shelly '' Sterling accused Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men . She claimed Donald Sterling used the couple 's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari , two Bentleys and a Range Rover , and that he helped her get a $ 1.8 million duplex . Who is V. Stiviano ? Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner , who made much of his fortune in real estate . Shelly Sterling was thrilled with the court decision Tuesday , her lawyer told CNN affiliate KABC . `` This is a victory for the Sterling family in recovering the $ 2,630,000 that Donald lavished on a conniving mistress , '' attorney Pierce O'Donnell said in a statement . `` It also sets a precedent that the injured spouse can recover damages from the recipient of these ill-begotten gifts . '' Stiviano 's gifts from Donald Sterling did n't just include uber-expensive items like luxury cars . According to the Los Angeles Times , the list also includes a $ 391 Easter bunny costume , a $ 299 two-speed blender and a $ 12 lace thong . Donald Sterling 's downfall came after an audio recording surfaced of the octogenarian arguing with Stiviano . In the tape , Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures on social media of her posing with African-Americans , including basketball legend Magic Johnson . `` In your lousy f**ing Instagrams , you do n't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people , '' Sterling said in the audio first posted by TMZ . He also tells Stiviano not to bring Johnson to Clippers games and not to post photos with the Hall of Famer so Sterling 's friends can see . `` Admire him , bring him here , feed him , f**k him , but do n't put ( Magic ) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me , '' Sterling said . NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league , fined him $ 2.5 million and pushed through a charge to terminate all of his ownership rights in the franchise .

But now it 's his former female companion who has lost big . A Los Angeles judge has ordered V. Stiviano to pay back more than $ 2.6 million in gifts after Sterling 's wife sued her . In the lawsuit , Rochelle `` Shelly '' Sterling accused Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men . She claimed Donald Sterling used the couple 's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari , two Bentleys and a Range Rover , and that he helped her get a $ 1.8 million duplex . Who is V. Stiviano ? Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner , who made much of his fortune in real estate . Shelly Sterling was thrilled with the court decision Tuesday , her lawyer told CNN affiliate KABC . `` This is a victory for the Sterling family in recovering the $ 2,630,000 that Donald lavished on a conniving mistress , '' attorney Pierce O'Donnell said in a statement . `` It also sets a precedent that the injured spouse can recover damages from the recipient of these ill-begotten gifts . '' Stiviano 's gifts from Donald Sterling did n't just include uber-expensive items like luxury cars . According to the Los Angeles Times , the list also includes a $ 391 Easter bunny costume , a $ 299 two-speed blender and a $ 12 lace thong . Donald Sterling 's downfall came after an audio recording surfaced of the octogenarian arguing with Stiviano . In the tape , Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures on social media of her posing with African-Americans , including basketball legend Magic Johnson . `` In your lousy f**ing Instagrams , you do n't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people , '' Sterling said in the audio first posted by TMZ . He also tells Stiviano not to bring Johnson to Clippers games and not to post photos with the Hall of Famer so Sterling 's friends can see . `` Admire him , bring him here , feed him , f**k him , but do n't put ( Magic ) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me , '' Sterling said . NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league , fined him $ 2.5 million and pushed through a charge to terminate all of his ownership rights in the franchise . Fact check : Donald Sterling 's claims vs. reality CNN 's Dottie Evans contributed to this report .\n\nSummary: \n\nDonald sterling 's wife sued stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men . She claimed donald sterling used the couple 's money to buy stiviano a ferrari , bentleys and a range rover . Stiviano 's gifts from donald sterling did n't just include uber-expensive items like luxury cars .\n\n\nEvaluation Form (scores ONLY):\n\n- Consistency:",

Kaitlyn Granado , 24 , a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving , was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student , and was released on bail . Now she has been arrested again after another pupil , also aged 15 , also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year . According to the affidavit , seen by the Star-Telegram , the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas . The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month . She was arrested on March 19 , and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year , according to the Dallas Morning News . She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials . At the time , detectives said they did n't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils , but just days later , on March 24 , officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her .

'' Producers will consult scholars in African and African-American history for added authenticity . `` We are proud to bring this saga to fans of the original , as well as to a new generation that will experience this powerful and poignant tale for the first time , '' said Dirk Hoogstra , History 's executive vice president and general manager . `` Audiences will once again feel the impact of Kunta Kinte 's indomitable spirit . '' Executive producer Mark Wolper , son of the original 's producer David L. Wolper , added , `` Kunta Kinte began telling his story over 200 years ago and that story went through his family lineage , to Alex Haley , to my father , and now the mantle rests with me . Like Kunta Kinte fought to tell his story over and over again , so must we . '' The remade `` Roots '' will encounter a new generation of viewers who have witnessed Barack Obama make history as the nation 's first African-American president and `` 12 Years a Slave '' win the Oscar for Best Picture , but also widespread racial unrest over police treatment of black suspects in many U.S. cities . `` My career began with 'Roots ' and I am proud to be a part of this new adaptation , '' said Burton . `` There is a huge audience of contemporary young Americans who do not know the story of 'Roots ' or its importance . ''\n\nSummary: \n\n`` roots , `` the epic miniseries about an african-american slave and his descendants , had a staggering audience of over 100 million viewers back in 1977 . Now a & e networks are remaking the miniseries , to air in 2016 . Producers will consult scholars in african and african-american history for added authenticity .\n\n\nEvaluation Form (scores ONLY):\n\n- Consistency:",

        "source": "( CNN ) A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded . The whale , named Varvara , swam nearly 14,000 miles ( 22,500 kilometers ) , according to a release from Oregon State University , whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study . Varvara , which is Russian for `` Barbara , '' left her primary feeding ground off Russia 's Sakhalin Island to cross the Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja , Mexico . Varvara 's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website . It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the `` warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions . '' Records are nice , but Bruce Mate , the lead author of the study , thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim . During her 14,000-mile journey , Varvara visited `` three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales , '' which was a surprise to Mate , who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University . `` For her to go to Mexico , '' Mate said , `` It 's pretty strong evidence that it 's where she 's from . '' Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale , but her ability to `` navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive , '' he said in the release , which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays . With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence , that number might be even lower . `` Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species , but this suggests we may need to take a closer look , '' Mate said .

        "source": "These extraordinary images show how an enormous jumbo jet has been converted into a luxury home for a mystery billionaire - complete with bedrooms , multiple lounges and an onboard restaurant . The custom-built Boeing 747 is believed to have cost its ultra-wealthy owner \u00a3400million after it was customised to fit his specifications exactly over a three-year period . The jumbo jet would normally carry as many as 600 passengers - but this version was built for just a single tycoon , although he will be able to fit dozens of guests .

We knew today we needed to put that right and I think we did that with a great result for us . 'We 've got ground to make up but we 'll just keep going , keep winning in games and putting in performances . Come the end of the season , you never know .

'It was n't my best game but I got the goal and helped the team . It was important after the defeats . ' Newcastle had what looked a strong shout for a penalty when Dejan Lovren appeared to foul Ayoze Perez in the area , and Allen admitted he thought it was a spot-kick . ' I did get a good view of it as I 'd missed the ball in the build-up , ' he said . 'It look a good shout for a penalty , but I did n't get one the other night . These things happen .

After a while the fish enjoyed being stroked and Mr Giroux noted that it would become frustrated if he didn \u2019 t play with it on a daily basis . The fish begins swimming around the man 's fingers and towards the surface as he removes his hand The man massages and plays with his fish for at least 15 minutes each day . The blood parrot cichlid is a hybrid of the midas and the redhead cichlid and was first bred in Taiwan around 1986 .\n\nSummary: \n\nCats and dogs have the advantage over marine pets in that they can interact with humans through the sense of touch . But that does n't prevent one man from dipping his hand in the fish tank and then treats it to a massage . The fish begins relaxing in the man 's hand and stays very still as the owner begins to stroke it with his finger .\n\n\nEvaluation Form (scores ONLY):\n\n- Consistency:",

Igor Konashenkov said the Russian jet flew around the U.S. plane several times to identify it and get its tail number . An official with the U.S. European Command said the claim that the transponder was off was false . Wright said the Pentagon and State Department will `` file the appropriate petition through diplomatic channels '' with Russia . This is not the first time the U.S. has complained about an incident involving a RC-135U and a SU-27 .

Kaitlyn Granado , 24 , a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving , was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student , and was released on bail . Now she has been arrested again after another pupil , also aged 15 , also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year . According to the affidavit , seen by the Star-Telegram , the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas . The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month . She was arrested on March 19 , and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year , according to the Dallas Morning News . She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials . At the time , detectives said they did n't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils , but just days later , on March 24 , officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her .

The top two sides in Group B meet at the Cardiff City Stadium on June 12 with Wales in their best position to qualify for a major tournament since the 1958 World Cup finals in Sweden . Belgium and Wales both have 11 points from five games with Marc Wilmots ' side - ranked fourth in the world - on top spot because of a superior goal difference . Wales ' Euro 2016 qualifier with Belgium this summer has been declared a 33,000 sell-out Gareth Bale fires homes a brilliant free-kick during Wales ' 3-0 victory over Israel in Euro 2016 qualifying Real Madrid star Bale celebrates as the victory took Wales to the top of the Group B table on goal difference But Wales ' comprehensive 3-0 victory in Israel last weekend has seen expectations rise that Chris Coleman 's charges can claim one of the two automatic qualifying spots and make it all the way to the 2016 finals in France . 'The stunning performance in Israel has created a huge buzz around Chris Coleman 's team and the FAW has been inundated with orders for tickets , ' the Football Association of Wales said in a statement on its website . 'Due to overwhelming demand , general admission tickets for the European qualifiers match between Wales and Belgium at the Cardiff City Stadium have now sold out . ' It is understood the Wales squad prefer to play at the Cardiff City Stadium rather than the Millennium Stadium There had been speculation that Wales would play Belgium at the 74,500 capacity Millennium Stadium with so much interest in the match . But that was never going to happen as UEFA rules prevent the venue being changed within 120 days of the scheduled date . It is understood Gareth Bale and company would prefer playing at the more intimate Cardiff City Stadium rather than the Millennium Stadium , where they have not played since meeting England in a Euro 2012 qualifier in March 2011 .\n\nSummary: \n\nWales ' Euro 2016 qualifier with Belgium this summer has been declared a 33,000 sell-out Wales ' players celebrate after beating Israel 3-0 in Euro 2016 qualifying Wales ' players celebrate after beating Israel 3-0 in Euro 2016 qualifying Wales ' players celebrate after beating Israel 3-0 in Euro 2016 qualifying Wales ' players celebrate after beating Israel 3-0 in Euro 2016 qualifying Wales ' players celebrate after beating Israel 3-0\n\n\nEvaluation Form (scores ONLY):\n\n- Consistency:",

        "source": "Chelsea have made an offer for FC Tokyo 's 22-year-old forward Yoshinori Muto , according to club president Naoki Ogane . The Japan international , who has played for the J-League side since 2013 , will join Chelsea 's Dutch partner club Vitesse Arnhem on loan next season if he completes a move to Stamford Bridge this summer . Ogane claims that Chelsea 's interest in Muto is not connected to the \u00a3200million sponsorship deal they signed with Japanese company Yokohama Rubber in February . FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto ( centre ) brings the ball forward against Albirex Niigata in March FC Tokyo president Naoki Ogane claims that Chelsea have made a bid for Japan international Muto Muto tussles with Yuji Nakazawa of Yokohama F.Marinos during a J-League clash last month Age : 22 Club : FC Tokyo Appearances : 37 Goals : 16 International caps ( Japan ) : 11 International goals : 1 Did you know ? Muto graduated from Keio University in Tokyo with an economics degree two weeks ago Speaking to Sports Nippon , Ogane said : 'It is true that Chelsea sent us an offer for Muto . 'It is a formal offer with conditions . They want to acquire him in the summer . ' Muto , who only graduated from Keio University a fortnight ago after completing an economics degree , would be the first Japanese player to represent Chelsea if he moves to west London . He has earned 11 caps for his country after signing his first professional contract in 2014 , scoring once for the Samurai Blue .

Kaitlyn Granado , 24 , a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving , was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student , and was released on bail . Now she has been arrested again after another pupil , also aged 15 , also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year . According to the affidavit , seen by the Star-Telegram , the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas . The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month . She was arrested on March 19 , and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year , according to the Dallas Morning News . She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials . At the time , detectives said they did n't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils , but just days later , on March 24 , officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her . A spokesman for the police department said : 'There was some discussion , some rumoring , there may have been a second person involved . 'That information came from within the school , and it turned out to be true . ' Granado , who is a maths teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving , Texas ( pictured ) , was also arrested last month when she admitted kissing another boy , also 15 , and lettin him touch her breasts Granado was booked into Irving County Jail for the second time on Monday , and released after posting a $ 50,000 bail . It is not known how Granado intends to plead to the second set of charges against her . A spokesman for Irving school district said : 'While privacy laws prevent us from sharing specific details , we can reassure our families that we took immediate and appropriate action . 'Being on administrative leave prevents her from working with students and being present on any Irving ISD property . '",

From Friday to Monday , a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued , according to the Italian coast guard , which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress . On Tuesday , a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing , citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast . The Italian coast guard , however , told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously , it can not confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued . An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors , nor bodies , nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized , Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said . There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats . Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy According to the International Organization for Migration , Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015 , and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily . Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria , the IOM said . They use Libya as a country of transit .

Luckily , Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government 's top military official earnestly revealed that the country 's Air Self Defense Force ( ASDF ) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object . Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki , Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet , Japan 's parliament , that his jets had , to date , never come across any UFOs from outer space . `` When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country 's airspace , it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation , '' Nakatani said . He continued : `` They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I do n't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth . '' Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as `` among the most respected men in sports-entertainment '' -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization . He entered Japan 's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013 . He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976 , in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches , which would later pave the way for today 's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests . Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products , from hot sauce to banks . The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages , and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman 's `` basketball diplomacy '' by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea . He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s , although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism . The lawmaker , who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements , had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats , and if research was being done into alien visitors , prompting Nakatani 's response . Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes , but admitted that he did n't know personally if aliens existed . The exchange was n't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet .

        "source": "Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has been handed the backing of five former England managers as he bids to push through radical changes . Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12 , however he is facing opposition from the Premier League . The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown ' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21 . FA chairman Greg Dyke ( left ) , speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore , wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs Graham Taylor , Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke , the Daily Telegraph reports . According to the newspaper , the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA 's England Commission . 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible , ' the letter reportedly says . It adds : 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup . ' Former England managers ( clockwise ) Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Steve McClaren and Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke 's call Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent . The managers add : 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility . 'However , as the England Commission 's evidence has demonstrated , the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it 's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager . ' The rise of Harry Kane ( centre ) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result , and Roy Hodgson 's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date , winning all five of their matches . There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players , the former England bosses reason . 'With promising players such as ( Ross ) Barkley , ( Raheem ) Sterling and ( Harry ) Kane starting to break through , it is clear we can still produce top young talent , ' they write . 'The one thing they are not being offered is the most important of all : opportunity . '",

FA chairman Greg Dyke ( left ) , speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore , wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs Graham Taylor , Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke , the Daily Telegraph reports . According to the newspaper , the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA 's England Commission . 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible , ' the letter reportedly says . It adds : 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup . ' Former England managers ( clockwise ) Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Steve McClaren and Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke 's call Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent . The managers add : 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility . 'However , as the England Commission 's evidence has demonstrated , the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it 's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager . ' The rise of Harry Kane ( centre ) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result , and Roy Hodgson 's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date , winning all five of their matches . There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players , the former England bosses reason . 'With promising players such as ( Ross ) Barkley , ( Raheem ) Sterling and ( Harry ) Kane starting to break through , it is clear we can still produce top young talent , ' they write . 'The one thing they are not being offered is the most important of all : opportunity . '\n\nSummary: \n\nDyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12 , however he is facing opposition from the premier league . Football association chairman greg dyke has been handed the backing of five former england managers as he bids to push through radical changes . The proposals also include changing the rules so that ` home-grown ' means having trained in england for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21 .\n\n\nEvaluation Form (scores ONLY):\n\n- Consistency:",

        "source": "( CNN ) Eight Iranian border guards have been killed in clashes with militants near the border with Pakistan , Iranian state media reported . Three of the militants were killed by Iranian forces in the fighting Monday in the southeastern town of Negur , the state-run news agency IRNA reported . The news agency cited Ali Asghar Mirshekari , the deputy governor of Iran 's Sistan-Baluchestan province , who said the militants crossed into the country from Pakistan . Iranian officials have reportedly asked Pakistani authorities to catch the surviving assailants . A militant group called Jaish al Adal claimed responsibility for the attack , according to Iranian state media and a Twitter account believed to be associated with the organization . According to Pakistani media , Jaish al Adal is an anti-Iranian group that has emerged during recent years in areas of Balochistan , the restive Pakistani province that borders southeastern Iran . The Sunni Muslim group has targeted Shiites and says it aims to thwart Iranian influence in Pakistan , according to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn . Jaish al Adal has also claimed responsibility for attacks on Iranian territory . One of the deadliest was in October 2013 , when 14 Iranian border guards were killed near the city of Saravan . Iranian authorities say that after similar attacks , the militants have fled back into Balochistan . `` Iran has repeatedly criticized its eastern neighbor for failing to rein in the terrorists , '' IRNA said , referring to Pakistan . The Pakistani government condemned Monday 's attack , calling it an `` act of terrorism . '' `` The concerned security agencies of Pakistan are actively investigating this incident , which took place on Iran 's territory , and have asked Iranian authorities to share with us any evidence that they have , '' the government said in a statement Wednesday . If the militants entered Pakistan after the attack , `` they will be apprehended and brought to justice , '' it said .",

Three of the militants were killed by Iranian forces in the fighting Monday in the southeastern town of Negur , the state-run news agency IRNA reported . The news agency cited Ali Asghar Mirshekari , the deputy governor of Iran 's Sistan-Baluchestan province , who said the militants crossed into the country from Pakistan . Iranian officials have reportedly asked Pakistani authorities to catch the surviving assailants . A militant group called Jaish al Adal claimed responsibility for the attack , according to Iranian state media and a Twitter account believed to be associated with the organization . According to Pakistani media , Jaish al Adal is an anti-Iranian group that has emerged during recent years in areas of Balochistan , the restive Pakistani province that borders southeastern Iran . The Sunni Muslim group has targeted Shiites and says it aims to thwart Iranian influence in Pakistan , according to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn . Jaish al Adal has also claimed responsibility for attacks on Iranian territory . One of the deadliest was in October 2013 , when 14 Iranian border guards were killed near the city of Saravan . Iranian authorities say that after similar attacks , the militants have fled back into Balochistan . `` Iran has repeatedly criticized its eastern neighbor for failing to rein in the terrorists , '' IRNA said , referring to Pakistan . The Pakistani government condemned Monday 's attack , calling it an `` act of terrorism . '' `` The concerned security agencies of Pakistan are actively investigating this incident , which took place on Iran 's territory , and have asked Iranian authorities to share with us any evidence that they have , '' the government said in a statement Wednesday . If the militants entered Pakistan after the attack , `` they will be apprehended and brought to justice , '' it said .\n\nSummary: \n\nThree of the militants were killed by iranian forces in the fighting monday in the southeastern town of negur .

        "source": "Sick of awkward father-daughter portraits ? Well one photographer has found an effective - if a little odd - way of making them more interesting . Japanese photographer Y\u00fbki Aoyama 's latest series of images capture po-faced teenagers pictured next to their fathers leaping into the air . In each picture the daughter looks directly into the camera smiling while her father pulls a dramatic pose . A series of images by photographer Y\u00fbki Aoyama sees fathers leaping into the air next to their daughters The images are from the 37-year-old 's latest book which roughly translates into Daughter and Salary Man . According to the photographer 's website the images allow the father who usually has to act serious to express his fun side by being ' a hero jumping the sky , enfold ( ing ) strong excitement and hope .

        "source": "( CNN ) A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded . The whale , named Varvara , swam nearly 14,000 miles ( 22,500 kilometers ) , according to a release from Oregon State University , whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study . Varvara , which is Russian for `` Barbara , '' left her primary feeding ground off Russia 's Sakhalin Island to cross the Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja , Mexico . Varvara 's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website . It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the `` warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions . '' Records are nice , but Bruce Mate , the lead author of the study , thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim . During her 14,000-mile journey , Varvara visited `` three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales , '' which was a surprise to Mate , who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University . `` For her to go to Mexico , '' Mate said , `` It 's pretty strong evidence that it 's where she 's from . '' Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale , but her ability to `` navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive , '' he said in the release , which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays . With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence , that number might be even lower . `` Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species , but this suggests we may need to take a closer look , '' Mate said .

Stephen Munden , 54 , described as having a 'fanatical obsession ' with small girls after he targeted a toddler on a bus , has been missing since 6.15pm on Tuesday and was last seen leaving a hospital , near Hook , Hampshire . Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl . A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit . Stephen Munden , 54 , ( pictured with and without a beard ) was last seen leaving a hospital , near Hook , Hampshire He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall , of a heavy build , and has dark hair . Officers said they believed that Munden , who suffers from learning difficulties , may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave . He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences . Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13 . A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child 's mother and grandmother . Munden , formerly of Marchwood , near Southampton , denied the offence , claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court . During the sentencing David Jenkins , prosecuting , told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children .

James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents , Phil , 44 , and Hazel , 38 , with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote . But security officers , who were described as 'over-zealous ' by the boy 's father , then took exception to James 's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system 's X-ray machines .

        "source": "Police are investigating claims by a former royal footman that palace aides tried to force him into an orgy , it was revealed yesterday . Christopher Lawler said he was pinned to a chair and groped by a male member of staff on his first day working at Clarence House . The ordeal left him in tears and he left the job the same day . He finally decided to contact palace officials again last year after inquiries began into alleged cover-ups of child sex abuse by a VIP paedophile ring in the 1970s and 80s . Police are investigating claims made by a former royal footman that Clarence House aides tried to force him into an orgy in the 1970s But his complaints were ignored for months before the police were finally notified , he claims . Mr Lawler , now 64 , said the attempted abuse at the Queen Mother \u2019 s London residence happened in January 1978 when he was 27 . He said he was accosted after he walked into a bedroom to look for a pen on his first shift . Two men offered him a drink before two other men joined them \u2013 one a senior member of staff , he said . He was asked if he was gay before a younger man took his trousers off and began performing a sex act on himself . \u2018 That prompted another guy to put his hand on my leg and then he grabbed me , \u2019 he told the Sunday People . \u2018 I was staggered . The younger man then came up behind me and gripped me , holding me in the chair . Mr Lawler worked at Clarence House when the Queen Mother used it as her London residence \u2018 They were trying to undo my trousers but I managed to jump up and burst out of the room. \u2019 Afterwards , Mr Lawler said he was followed by two men and threatened to keep quiet . A complaint he made that day allegedly drew an angry response from Clarence House \u2013 so he packed his bags immediately . Mr Lawler , a former Port of Liverpool police officer , said he was \u2018 haunted \u2019 by the incident for years . After hearing about the probe into historical cases of child abuse last year he wrote to the Palace , but was twice rebuffed . Months later the complaint was finally passed to Scotland Yard . A retired royal aide , who is now in his 80s , was reportedly interviewed but denied he was involved because he was working for the Queen in Balmoral at the time . Mr Lawler has now been told by the Palace that the Royal Household would work \u2018 exhaustively and co-operatively \u2019 with any police probe . A police spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment \u2018 as investigations continue \u2019 .",

Christopher Lawler said he was pinned to a chair and groped by a male member of staff on his first day working at Clarence House . The ordeal left him in tears and he left the job the same day . He finally decided to contact palace officials again last year after inquiries began into alleged cover-ups of child sex abuse by a VIP paedophile ring in the 1970s and 80s . Police are investigating claims made by a former royal footman that Clarence House aides tried to force him into an orgy in the 1970s But his complaints were ignored for months before the police were finally notified , he claims . Mr Lawler , now 64 , said the attempted abuse at the Queen Mother \u2019 s London residence happened in January 1978 when he was 27 . He said he was accosted after he walked into a bedroom to look for a pen on his first shift . Two men offered him a drink before two other men joined them \u2013 one a senior member of staff , he said . He was asked if he was gay before a younger man took his trousers off and began performing a sex act on himself . \u2018 That prompted another guy to put his hand on my leg and then he grabbed me , \u2019 he told the Sunday People . \u2018 I was staggered . The younger man then came up behind me and gripped me , holding me in the chair . Mr Lawler worked at Clarence House when the Queen Mother used it as her London residence \u2018 They were trying to undo my trousers but I managed to jump up and burst out of the room. \u2019 Afterwards , Mr Lawler said he was followed by two men and threatened to keep quiet . A complaint he made that day allegedly drew an angry response from Clarence House \u2013 so he packed his bags immediately . Mr Lawler , a former Port of Liverpool police officer , said he was \u2018 haunted \u2019 by the incident for years . After hearing about the probe into historical cases of child abuse last year he wrote to the Palace , but was twice rebuffed . Months later the complaint was finally passed to Scotland Yard . A retired royal aide , who is now in his 80s , was reportedly interviewed but denied he was involved because he was working for the Queen in Balmoral at the time . Mr Lawler has now been told by the Palace that the Royal Household would work \u2018 exhaustively and co-operatively \u2019 with any police probe . A police spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment \u2018 as investigations continue \u2019 .\n\nSummary: \n\nPolice are investigating claims by a former royal footman that palace aides tried to force him into an orgy , it was revealed yesterday . Christopher lawler said he was pinned to a chair and groped by a male member of staff on his first day working at clarence house .

Stephen Munden , 54 , described as having a 'fanatical obsession ' with small girls after he targeted a toddler on a bus , has been missing since 6.15pm on Tuesday and was last seen leaving a hospital , near Hook , Hampshire . Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl . A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit . Stephen Munden , 54 , ( pictured with and without a beard ) was last seen leaving a hospital , near Hook , Hampshire He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall , of a heavy build , and has dark hair . Officers said they believed that Munden , who suffers from learning difficulties , may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave . He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences . Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13 . A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child 's mother and grandmother . Munden , formerly of Marchwood , near Southampton , denied the offence , claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court . During the sentencing David Jenkins , prosecuting , told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children .

        "source": "First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby ' . Kits aside , this was probably as far removed from Sunday 's big match as you could imagine . For a start , no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English . Of those , 10 were Mancunian . Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick Ticket prices ? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen . Altrincham 's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford , but it does have a proud history of its own . It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United 's Carrington complex , where Paul McGuinness 's Under 18s usually ply their trade . The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors . And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team . In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood , from just down the road in Sale , came closest for City with an audacious chip . United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby ' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford , another local lad from whom big things are expected , wasted two decent opportunities when put through . Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first . In March , the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players . He was at it again here , showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul . After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal . Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson 's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post . The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser . Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote . The result leaves United , who have won two of this year 's cross-town clashes , two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand . Injury-ravaged City however , have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series . FA chief Greg Dyke recently bemoaned the lack of first-team opportunities for homegrown talent between the ages of 18 and 21 . On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment , there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment , there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the coming years .",

Kits aside , this was probably as far removed from Sunday 's big match as you could imagine . For a start , no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English . Of those , 10 were Mancunian . Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick Ticket prices ? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen . Altrincham 's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford , but it does have a proud history of its own . It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United 's Carrington complex , where Paul McGuinness 's Under 18s usually ply their trade . The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors . And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team . In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood , from just down the road in Sale , came closest for City with an audacious chip . United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby ' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford , another local lad from whom big things are expected , wasted two decent opportunities when put through . Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first . In March , the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players . He was at it again here , showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul . After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal . Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson 's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post . The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser . Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote . The result leaves United , who have won two of this year 's cross-town clashes , two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand . Injury-ravaged City however , have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series . FA chief Greg Dyke recently bemoaned the lack of first-team opportunities for homegrown talent between the ages of 18 and 21 . On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment , there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment , there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the coming years .\n\nSummary: \n\nCallum gribbin was the matchwinner for manchester united with a delightful free-kick .

Sky Sports pundit Thierry Henry questioned whether Arsenal can win the title with Olivier Giroud in attack Henry ( centre ) said after Arsenal 's goalless draw with Chelsea that Giroud ( right ) may need replacing Hull ( away ) - May 4 Swansea ( home ) - May 11 Man United ( away ) - May 17 Sunderland ( home ) May 20 West Brom ( home ) - May 24 Speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports , Henry said : ' I think they need to buy four players - they need that spine . They need a goalkeeper , they still need a centre back , they still need a holding midfielder and , I 'm afraid , they need a top , top quality striker to win this league again . 'You had the best example with Chelsea here today . They were struggling last season to win the league . They went on to buy [ Thibaut ] Cortouis , [ Nemanja ] Matic , Cesc [ Fabregas ] and [ Diego ] Costa . 'For me , that speaks volumes and you saw it today - a team did n't and a team did , and they are about to win the league again . Arsenal are third in the Premier League , level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand 'He [ Arsene Wenger ] has to do it . You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league , that has to happen . ' And he added on Giroud 's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season : ' I think Giroud is doing extremely well . But can you win the league with him ? I would n't think so . 'He does a job , and he does it ever so well , but you ca n't win the league . 'Arsenal were at the top of the league last season , but everyone was saying they are not going win the league . ' Arsenal need to sign players of a similar calibre to Thibaut Courtois , Nemanja Matic , Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa , according to Henry Giroud , pictured during Arsenal 's match against Chelsea , has scored 14 Premier League goals this season\n\nSummary: \n\nThierry henry has criticised arsenal 's recent dealings in the transfer window . The frenchman believes arsenal need to buy four players in the summer . Sky sports pundit thierry henry questioned whether arsenal can win the title .\n\n\nEvaluation Form (scores ONLY):\n\n- Consistency:",

Kaitlyn Granado , 24 , a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving , was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student , and was released on bail . Now she has been arrested again after another pupil , also aged 15 , also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year . According to the affidavit , seen by the Star-Telegram , the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas . The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month . She was arrested on March 19 , and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year , according to the Dallas Morning News . She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials . At the time , detectives said they did n't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils , but just days later , on March 24 , officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her . A spokesman for the police department said : 'There was some discussion , some rumoring , there may have been a second person involved . 'That information came from within the school , and it turned out to be true . ' Granado , who is a maths teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving , Texas ( pictured ) , was also arrested last month when she admitted kissing another boy , also 15 , and lettin him touch her breasts Granado was booked into Irving County Jail for the second time on Monday , and released after posting a $ 50,000 bail . It is not known how Granado intends to plead to the second set of charges against her . A spokesman for Irving school district said : 'While privacy laws prevent us from sharing specific details , we can reassure our families that we took immediate and appropriate action . 'Being on administrative leave prevents her from working with students and being present on any Irving ISD property . '",

Hughes was shown a red card for the offence , but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded . Although it was accepted that there had been no intent , the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing .

        "source": "This is the embarrassing moment a Buckingham Palace guard slipped and fell on a manhole cover in front of hundreds of shocked tourists as he took up position in his sentry box . The Queen 's Guard was left red-faced after he slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard - and unfortunately for him the entire incident was caught on camera . He lost his footing and slid sideways , knocking his bearskin on the side of the box and dropping his rifle . The Queen 's Guard ( pictured ) slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace last week . Unfortunately for him , the entire incident was caught on a tourist 's camera The embarrassed soldier quickly scrambled to his feet as his colleagues marched past as if nothing had happened . But the young guard started to blush as he peered at the crowd from under his bearskin and realised how many people had seen his slapstick moment . Holidaymaker David Meadwell recorded the unscheduled manouevre outside Buckingham Palace on Thursday afternoon . Mr Meadwell , 50 , from Newcastle-upon-Tyne , said : ' I was with my family for a trip to London and I thought I 'd take some pictures of the changing of the guards . Tourist David Meadwell shot this footage of the Changing of the Guard last week when the incident unfolded The moment it all started to go wrong : The guard leans heavily to the side as he appears to slip The unidentified young guard 's legs appear to get a bit tangled as he tries to turn to march away The guard , wearing full regalia , falls heavily to the floor still clutching his rifle following the slip up 'The first group changed successfully , without any problems , and so I decided to video the next group doing it . ' I did n't expect anything like this to happen - he went flying . There were quite a few people around and there were a lot of gasps as he went down . ' I think he just slipped on a manhole cover , he looked so embarrassed . ' The unnamed solider is thought to have slipped because of the metal protectors nailed to the soles of his boots . Tourists gather in their thousands to watch the changing of the guard outside Buckingham Palace at 11.30am every day in the summer and every other day in the winter . The Guard comprises two detachments , one each for Buckingham Palace and St James 's Palace , under the command of the Captain of The Queen 's Guard . Contrary to popular belief they are not purely ceremonial and are fully operational soldiers .

The Queen 's Guard was left red-faced after he slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard - and unfortunately for him the entire incident was caught on camera . He lost his footing and slid sideways , knocking his bearskin on the side of the box and dropping his rifle . The Queen 's Guard ( pictured ) slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace last week . Unfortunately for him , the entire incident was caught on a tourist 's camera The embarrassed soldier quickly scrambled to his feet as his colleagues marched past as if nothing had happened . But the young guard started to blush as he peered at the crowd from under his bearskin and realised how many people had seen his slapstick moment . Holidaymaker David Meadwell recorded the unscheduled manouevre outside Buckingham Palace on Thursday afternoon . Mr Meadwell , 50 , from Newcastle-upon-Tyne , said : ' I was with my family for a trip to London and I thought I 'd take some pictures of the changing of the guards . Tourist David Meadwell shot this footage of the Changing of the Guard last week when the incident unfolded The moment it all started to go wrong : The guard leans heavily to the side as he appears to slip The unidentified young guard 's legs appear to get a bit tangled as he tries to turn to march away The guard , wearing full regalia , falls heavily to the floor still clutching his rifle following the slip up 'The first group changed successfully , without any problems , and so I decided to video the next group doing it . ' I did n't expect anything like this to happen - he went flying . There were quite a few people around and there were a lot of gasps as he went down . ' I think he just slipped on a manhole cover , he looked so embarrassed . ' The unnamed solider is thought to have slipped because of the metal protectors nailed to the soles of his boots . Tourists gather in their thousands to watch the changing of the guard outside Buckingham Palace at 11.30am every day in the summer and every other day in the winter . The Guard comprises two detachments , one each for Buckingham Palace and St James 's Palace , under the command of the Captain of The Queen 's Guard . Contrary to popular belief they are not purely ceremonial and are fully operational soldiers . The Ministry of Defence said they would not comment on ' a young man falling over while doing his job ' . The embarrassed guard hastily scrambled to his feet following the unfortunate tumble at the palace The incident took place in front of hundreds of tourists who were watching the Changing of the Guard\n\nSummary: \n\nThe queen 's guard was left red-faced after he slipped on a manhole cover during the popular changing of the guard - and unfortunately for him the entire incident was caught on camera .

He finally decided to contact palace officials again last year after inquiries began into alleged cover-ups of child sex abuse by a VIP paedophile ring in the 1970s and 80s . Police are investigating claims made by a former royal footman that Clarence House aides tried to force him into an orgy in the 1970s But his complaints were ignored for months before the police were finally notified , he claims . Mr Lawler , now 64 , said the attempted abuse at the Queen Mother \u2019 s London residence happened in January 1978 when he was 27 . He said he was accosted after he walked into a bedroom to look for a pen on his first shift .

        "source": "Mexican restaurant Chipotle has decided to tap into the $ 70 billion food delivery market by teaming up with an app to bring burritos straight to customers ' doors . The fast-casual chain will work with the Postmates app to begin offering delivery for online and mobile orders in 67 cities , according to a report in Nation 's Restaurant News . But Mexican food fans should know that the restaurant plans to add a nine per cent service charge - with the delivery fees for Postmates beginning at $ 5 and up , depending on distance and demand . New venture : Mexican restaurant Chipotle has decided to tap into the $ 70 billion food delivery market by teaming up with an app to bring burritos straight to customers ' doors Chipotle is thought to have turned down previous offers of collaboration with third-party delivery services - but has now given Postmates the green light , New York Daily News reports . The app hires independent contractors who drive their own cars in a similar model to Uber taxis . Chipotle has gone from strength to strength in recent years and this month two presidential candidates have been spotted in their restaurants . Republican contender Marco Rubio is a regular in the outlets and recently told MailOnline that he always tips staff . Cashing on delivery market : The fast-casual chain will work with the Postmates app to begin offering delivery for online and mobile orders in 67 cities And just one day into her presidential campaign , Hillary Clinton was seen in a Chipotle in Maumee , Ohio where she ordered a chicken dish with guacamole , a chicken salad and fruit juice .

Luckily , Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government 's top military official earnestly revealed that the country 's Air Self Defense Force ( ASDF ) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object . Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki , Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet , Japan 's parliament , that his jets had , to date , never come across any UFOs from outer space . `` When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country 's airspace , it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation , '' Nakatani said . He continued : `` They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I do n't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth . '' Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as `` among the most respected men in sports-entertainment '' -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization . He entered Japan 's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013 . He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976 , in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches , which would later pave the way for today 's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests . Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products , from hot sauce to banks . The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages , and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman 's `` basketball diplomacy '' by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea . He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s , although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism . The lawmaker , who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements , had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats , and if research was being done into alien visitors , prompting Nakatani 's response . Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes , but admitted that he did n't know personally if aliens existed . The exchange was n't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet . In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications , under Japan 's pacifist constitution , of a defense against an invasion from outer space .

They need a goalkeeper , they still need a centre back , they still need a holding midfielder and , I 'm afraid , they need a top , top quality striker to win this league again . 'You had the best example with Chelsea here today . They were struggling last season to win the league . They went on to buy [ Thibaut ] Cortouis , [ Nemanja ] Matic , Cesc [ Fabregas ] and [ Diego ] Costa . 'For me , that speaks volumes and you saw it today - a team did n't and a team did , and they are about to win the league again . Arsenal are third in the Premier League , level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand 'He [ Arsene Wenger ] has to do it . You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league , that has to happen . ' And he added on Giroud 's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season : ' I think Giroud is doing extremely well . But can you win the league with him ? I would n't think so . 'He does a job , and he does it ever so well , but you ca n't win the league . 'Arsenal were at the top of the league last season , but everyone was saying they are not going win the league . ' Arsenal need to sign players of a similar calibre to Thibaut Courtois , Nemanja Matic , Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa , according to Henry Giroud , pictured during Arsenal 's match against Chelsea , has scored 14 Premier League goals this season\n\nSummary: \n\nArsenal need a goalkeeper , centre back , defensive midfielder and striker if they are to have any chance of winning the barclays premier league title .

        "source": "Kaitlyn Granado , 24 , was arrested on Monday amid claims she had sex with pupil , 15 , in her car on consecutive nights in January A Texas math teacher has been accused of having sex with an underage pupil from a Texas high school a month after she was arrested for letting another teenage touch her breasts . Kaitlyn Granado , 24 , a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving , was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student , and was released on bail . Now she has been arrested again after another pupil , also aged 15 , also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year . According to the affidavit , seen by the Star-Telegram , the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas . The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month . She was arrested on March 19 , and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year , according to the Dallas Morning News . She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials . At the time , detectives said they did n't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils , but just days later , on March 24 , officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her . A spokesman for the police department said : 'There was some discussion , some rumoring , there may have been a second person involved . 'That information came from within the school , and it turned out to be true . ' Granado , who is a maths teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving , Texas ( pictured ) , was also arrested last month when she admitted kissing another boy , also 15 , and lettin him touch her breasts Granado was booked into Irving County Jail for the second time on Monday , and released after posting a $ 50,000 bail . It is not known how Granado intends to plead to the second set of charges against her . A spokesman for Irving school district said : 'While privacy laws prevent us from sharing specific details , we can reassure our families that we took immediate and appropriate action . 'Being on administrative leave prevents her from working with students and being present on any Irving ISD property . '",

Kaitlyn Granado , 24 , a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving , was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student , and was released on bail . Now she has been arrested again after another pupil , also aged 15 , also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year . According to the affidavit , seen by the Star-Telegram , the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas . The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month . She was arrested on March 19 , and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year , according to the Dallas Morning News . She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials . At the time , detectives said they did n't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils , but just days later , on March 24 , officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her . A spokesman for the police department said : 'There was some discussion , some rumoring , there may have been a second person involved . 'That information came from within the school , and it turned out to be true . ' Granado , who is a maths teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving , Texas ( pictured ) , was also arrested last month when she admitted kissing another boy , also 15 , and lettin him touch her breasts Granado was booked into Irving County Jail for the second time on Monday , and released after posting a $ 50,000 bail . It is not known how Granado intends to plead to the second set of charges against her . A spokesman for Irving school district said : 'While privacy laws prevent us from sharing specific details , we can reassure our families that we took immediate and appropriate action . 'Being on administrative leave prevents her from working with students and being present on any Irving ISD property . '\n\nSummary: \n\nKaitlyn granado , 24 , was arrested on monday amid claims she had sex with pupil , 15 , in her car on consecutive nights in january kaitlyn granado , 24 , a teacher at macarthur high school in irving , was first arrested on march 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15 - year - old student , and was released on bail .

        "source": "( CNN ) After a Russian fighter jet intercepted a U.S. reconnaissance plane in an `` unsafe and unprofessional manner '' earlier this week , the United States is complaining to Moscow about the incident . On Tuesday , a U.S. RC-135U was flying over the Baltic Sea when it was intercepted by a Russian SU-27 Flanker . The Pentagon said the incident occurred in international airspace north of Poland . The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot 's actions were `` unsafe and unprofessional due to the aggressive maneuvers it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed , '' Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said . Russian state news agency Sputnik reported the U.S. plane was flying toward the Russian border with its transponder switched off , according to a Defense Ministry spokesman . Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the Russian jet flew around the U.S. plane several times to identify it and get its tail number . An official with the U.S. European Command said the claim that the transponder was off was false . Wright said the Pentagon and State Department will `` file the appropriate petition through diplomatic channels '' with Russia . This is not the first time the U.S. has complained about an incident involving a RC-135U and a SU-27 . A year ago , a Russian jet flew within 100 feet of a RC-135U over the Sea of Okhotsk in the western Pacific , according to U.S. officials who called it `` one of the most dangerous close passes in decades . '' The Pentagon complained to the Russia military about that incident . Russian and U.S. aircraft often encounter each other , both in Northern Europe as well as the area between the Russian Far East and Alaska . CNN 's Steve Brusk and Jamie Crawford contributed to this report .",

On Tuesday , a U.S. RC-135U was flying over the Baltic Sea when it was intercepted by a Russian SU-27 Flanker . The Pentagon said the incident occurred in international airspace north of Poland . The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot 's actions were `` unsafe and unprofessional due to the aggressive maneuvers it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed , '' Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said . Russian state news agency Sputnik reported the U.S. plane was flying toward the Russian border with its transponder switched off , according to a Defense Ministry spokesman . Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the Russian jet flew around the U.S. plane several times to identify it and get its tail number . An official with the U.S. European Command said the claim that the transponder was off was false . Wright said the Pentagon and State Department will `` file the appropriate petition through diplomatic channels '' with Russia . This is not the first time the U.S. has complained about an incident involving a RC-135U and a SU-27 . A year ago , a Russian jet flew within 100 feet of a RC-135U over the Sea of Okhotsk in the western Pacific , according to U.S. officials who called it `` one of the most dangerous close passes in decades . '' The Pentagon complained to the Russia military about that incident . Russian and U.S. aircraft often encounter each other , both in Northern Europe as well as the area between the Russian Far East and Alaska . CNN 's Steve Brusk and Jamie Crawford contributed to this report .\n\nSummary: \n\nThe U.S. RC-135U was flying over the Baltic Sea when it was intercepted by a Russian SU-27 Flanker . The Pentagon said the Russian jet flew around the U.S. plane several times to identify it and get its tail number .

Most of those released were women and children ; the rest were ill or elderly , said Rassol Omar , a commander in the Peshmerga force that defends northern Iraq 's semi-autonomous Kurdish region . Omar did n't say what led to the release , other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it . The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga , who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital , Irbil , said Nuri Osman , an official with Iraq 's Kurdistan Regional Government . It was n't immediately clear what motivated Wednesday 's release , Osman said . Osman said 217 Yazidis were released . Omar , the Peshmerga commander , had a higher count : 228 .

One of the oldest religious communities in the world , the Yazidis have long suffered persecution , with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshipers .

He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city 's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport . The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia . `` The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from , '' Durken said . The fires were started in southeastern Siberia , by farmers burning grass in their fields . But on April 14 , it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region , according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV . As a result , the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region . Rescue crews were able to put out the flames . However , the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds . The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest . Parts of Oregon , Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke , wind and solar light combination . The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens , blues , yellows and purples , KOMO-TV said . That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered . The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person 's eye .

Kevin Rebbie , 56 , of Limerick Township , faces several charges , including aggravated indecent assault , unlawful contact with a minor , sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy , the Montgomery County District Attorney 's Office said . The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March , according to prosecutors . She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep . She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13 , Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her , according to Philly.com . Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom , 34 of which showed victims as they showered . Rebbie uploaded the videos , some that included close-up images of children 's genitalia , to his computer to view later , prosecutors said . The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period , according to prosecutors . Rebbie admitted to filming several victims , including other juveniles , but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered , according to the Pottstown Mercury .

        "source": "These extraordinary images show how an enormous jumbo jet has been converted into a luxury home for a mystery billionaire - complete with bedrooms , multiple lounges and an onboard restaurant . The custom-built Boeing 747 is believed to have cost its ultra-wealthy owner \u00a3400million after it was customised to fit his specifications exactly over a three-year period . The jumbo jet would normally carry as many as 600 passengers - but this version was built for just a single tycoon , although he will be able to fit dozens of guests .

        "source": "After Chelsea forward Eden Hazard had scored give his side a 1-0 lead against Manchester United at Stamford Bridge on Saturday , the Sky Sports punditry team were convinced that there had been a foul in the build-up . Chelsea captain John Terry had come in with a strong challenge from behind on United striker Radamel Falcao which sent the Colombian hurtling to the ground . Blues midfielder Cesc Fabregas then collected the loose ball and released it to Oscar before his back-heel sent it into the path of the oncoming Hazard to slot home . Chelsea defender John Terry comes in from behind with a strong challenge on Radamel Falcao Terry 's challenge on Falcao came during the build-up to Eden Hazard 's opening goal for Chelsea The Manchester United striker struggles to hold his grand and loses the ball to Terry near the half-way line Terry 's strong challenge leads to a loose ball that is picked up by Cesc Fabregas to start of the scoring move Without taking anything away from the sublime spectacle of the goal , pundits Thierry Henry , Jamie Redknapp and Graeme Souness agreed during their half-time analysis that play should have been stopped for Terry 's rough tackle on Falcao . Souness said , 'It 's a decent forearm smash . I mean he does stick his elbow in the back of Falcao 's head and that 's a foul . ' He added , 'If that elbow 's not there he 's not going down like that . ' Former Arsenal captain Henry , meanwhile , felt sympathy for Falcao as a fellow striker .

        "source": "Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has been handed the backing of five former England managers as he bids to push through radical changes . Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12 , however he is facing opposition from the Premier League . The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown ' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21 . FA chairman Greg Dyke ( left ) , speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore , wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs Graham Taylor , Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke , the Daily Telegraph reports . According to the newspaper , the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA 's England Commission . 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible , ' the letter reportedly says . It adds : 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup . ' Former England managers ( clockwise ) Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Steve McClaren and Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke 's call Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent . The managers add : 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility . 'However , as the England Commission 's evidence has demonstrated , the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it 's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager . ' The rise of Harry Kane ( centre ) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result , and Roy Hodgson 's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date , winning all five of their matches . There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players , the former England bosses reason . 'With promising players such as ( Ross ) Barkley , ( Raheem ) Sterling and ( Harry ) Kane starting to break through , it is clear we can still produce top young talent , ' they write . 'The one thing they are not being offered is the most important of all : opportunity . '",

Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12 , however he is facing opposition from the Premier League . The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown ' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21 . FA chairman Greg Dyke ( left ) , speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore , wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs Graham Taylor , Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke , the Daily Telegraph reports . According to the newspaper , the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA 's England Commission . 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible , ' the letter reportedly says . It adds : 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup . ' Former England managers ( clockwise ) Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Steve McClaren and Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke 's call Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent . The managers add : 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility . 'However , as the England Commission 's evidence has demonstrated , the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it 's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager . ' The rise of Harry Kane ( centre ) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result , and Roy Hodgson 's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date , winning all five of their matches . There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players , the former England bosses reason . 'With promising players such as ( Ross ) Barkley , ( Raheem ) Sterling and ( Harry ) Kane starting to break through , it is clear we can still produce top young talent , ' they write . 'The one thing they are not being offered is the most important of all : opportunity . '\n\nSummary: \n\nFootball association chairman greg dyke has been handed the backing of five former england managers as he bids to push through radical changes .

Scroll down for video Devastated : Dawn , who has had seven miscarriages , was furious to discover her friend had stolen from her The drama began when Dawn , who has previously appeared on the ITV talk show , discovered that \u00a3207 set aside for a \u00a3500 grave stone had disappeared . Suspecting house-mate Jamie and his girlfriend Carol , she confronted them but was initially met with a flat denial .

' Unable to prove it , she asked Mr Kyle to conduct a lie detector test and when the results came back , it showed that Jamie had indeed taken the cash . Caught out : Jamie , who has been to prison for burglary , was found to be lying after taking a test Outraged : Dawn , who was going to spend the money on a gravestone , was left furious by the revelation Mr Kyle also revealed that Jamie had sent a Facebook message to Dawn during the journey to London in which he declared his undying love and confessed to taking the money but blamed it on girlfriend Carol . Speaking after the show , a sobbing Dawn said : ' I 've had seven miscarriages and only one of them I 've had to bury . 'That was Daniel James and the \u00a3207 was put aside because the head stone was going to cost \u00a3500 altogether .

Mr Lawler worked at Clarence House when the Queen Mother used it as her London residence \u2018 They were trying to undo my trousers but I managed to jump up and burst out of the room. \u2019 Afterwards , Mr Lawler said he was followed by two men and threatened to keep quiet . A complaint he made that day allegedly drew an angry response from Clarence House \u2013 so he packed his bags immediately . Mr Lawler , a former Port of Liverpool police officer , said he was \u2018 haunted \u2019 by the incident for years . After hearing about the probe into historical cases of child abuse last year he wrote to the Palace , but was twice rebuffed . Months later the complaint was finally passed to Scotland Yard . A retired royal aide , who is now in his 80s , was reportedly interviewed but denied he was involved because he was working for the Queen in Balmoral at the time . Mr Lawler has now been told by the Palace that the Royal Household would work \u2018 exhaustively and co-operatively \u2019 with any police probe . A police spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment \u2018 as investigations continue \u2019 .\n\nSummary: \n\nChristopher Lawler said he was pinned to a chair and groped by a male member of staff on his first day working at Clarence House . The ordeal left him in tears and he left the job the same day . His complaints were ignored for months before the police were finally notified .\n\n\nEvaluation Form (scores ONLY):\n\n- Consistency:",

        "source": "( CNN ) A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded . The whale , named Varvara , swam nearly 14,000 miles ( 22,500 kilometers ) , according to a release from Oregon State University , whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study . Varvara , which is Russian for `` Barbara , '' left her primary feeding ground off Russia 's Sakhalin Island to cross the Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja , Mexico . Varvara 's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website . It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the `` warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions . '' Records are nice , but Bruce Mate , the lead author of the study , thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim . During her 14,000-mile journey , Varvara visited `` three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales , '' which was a surprise to Mate , who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University . `` For her to go to Mexico , '' Mate said , `` It 's pretty strong evidence that it 's where she 's from . '' Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale , but her ability to `` navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive , '' he said in the release , which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays . With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence , that number might be even lower . `` Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species , but this suggests we may need to take a closer look , '' Mate said .

        "source": "Thousands of holidaymakers caught up in last summer \u2019 s passport delay fiasco have not received any compensation . At the same time , managers at the passport agency , which made a \u00a342 million profit during the chaos , received up to \u00a33,500 in bonuses . Ministers refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through , and even to some who missed out on trips . Scroll down for video The boxes of passport applications piled up at in office in Liverpool at the peak of the backlog last summer Keith Vaz , who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation , said last night : \u2018 I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office , especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds. \u2019 The problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents . By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system . Ministers agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service , but thousands had already paid the extra \u00a330 per passport for this . Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time . Details obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office . In total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year , scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year . The total paid out was \u00a3203,066 , giving an average sum of \u00a392.68 . The biggest single payout was \u00a35,463 ; the lowest \u00a31 . The Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected , partly because of \u2018 the system failure of our customer complaint database \u2019 . It can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated , saying : \u2018 It would create a precedent. \u2019 Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished ' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved This newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time . Only one had got money back . Among those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham . They lost close to \u00a31,500 on a trip to Morocco , where he had planned to propose , because their passports did not arrive in time \u2013 even though they had applied ten weeks before they were due to travel and paid for upgrades .

At the same time , managers at the passport agency , which made a \u00a342 million profit during the chaos , received up to \u00a33,500 in bonuses . Ministers refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through , and even to some who missed out on trips . Scroll down for video The boxes of passport applications piled up at in office in Liverpool at the peak of the backlog last summer Keith Vaz , who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation , said last night : \u2018 I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office , especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds. \u2019 The problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents . By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system . Ministers agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service , but thousands had already paid the extra \u00a330 per passport for this . Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time . Details obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office . In total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year , scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year . The total paid out was \u00a3203,066 , giving an average sum of \u00a392.68 . The biggest single payout was \u00a35,463 ; the lowest \u00a31 . The Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected , partly because of \u2018 the system failure of our customer complaint database \u2019 . It can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated , saying : \u2018 It would create a precedent. \u2019 Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished ' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved This newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time . Only one had got money back . Among those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham . They lost close to \u00a31,500 on a trip to Morocco , where he had planned to propose , because their passports did not arrive in time \u2013 even though they had applied ten weeks before they were due to travel and paid for upgrades .

Alexis Sanchez was courted by a number of elite clubs last summer but eventually chose Arsenal Sanchez has made an instant impact in English football and has scored 19 goals so far this season Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger ( right ) is delighted that Sanchez decided to join the north London club 'At the end of the day , only Sanchez can explain to you why he has chosen us . I do n't know why he did that , but we are happy that he made that decision , ' said Wenger of the \u00a332million Chile forward , who has netted 19 goals so far . ' I was ( aware of Liverpool 's interest ) , but you never know if it is really true , but I thought it could be because of the interest in Suarez ( from Barcelona ) . 'In the negotiations , yes , it is a strength - and it makes sense , an exchange and some money for Liverpool . ' Wenger believes the way Sanchez has adapted so quickly to a change in environment proves he is one of the best around . 'If you look at the qualities , efficiency , work-rate , fighting spirit - ( he is at the ) top , ' the Arsenal boss added . 'When it ( the game ) becomes flat , he can revitalise the strengths and dynamics of the team and the supporters . ' Ahead of the key Barclays Premier League clash , Wenger was keen to play down any talk of a potential summer transfer move for Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling , who has so far rejected a new contract offer . Despite the Reds having lost to Manchester United before the international break to dent hopes of another top-four finish , Wenger has been impressed by the way Brendan Rodgers has developed his team following the sale of Suarez and injury to striker Daniel Sturridge . 'He has done very well . I think he found a solution at the right time , ' the Arsenal manager said . 'They did well last season too , they scored over 100 goals in the Premier League , which is absolutely fantastic . ' Wenger has moved to play down speculation linking him with Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling\n\nSummary: \n\nAlexis Sanchez joined Arsenal from Barcelona for \u00a3 32million last summer . Arsene Wenger says he does not know why Sanchez chose the Gunners . Wenger admits Liverpool 's interest in Sanchez was always on the cards . The Arsenal boss has played down talk of a move for Raheem Sterling .\n\n\nEvaluation Form (scores ONLY):\n\n- Consistency:",

A \u00a34million deal for the youngster has been mooted , but Muto admits that he is n't sure if he will join the Premier League title chasers despite being pleased with their bid . He said : ' I have not decided yet at all . It is an honour for me to receive this offer from a great club . ' Muto scored 13 times in his debut season with FC Tokyo and was named in the J-League 's best XI .

Stephen Munden , 54 , described as having a 'fanatical obsession ' with small girls after he targeted a toddler on a bus , has been missing since 6.15pm on Tuesday and was last seen leaving a hospital , near Hook , Hampshire . Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl . A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit . Stephen Munden , 54 , ( pictured with and without a beard ) was last seen leaving a hospital , near Hook , Hampshire He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall , of a heavy build , and has dark hair . Officers said they believed that Munden , who suffers from learning difficulties , may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave . He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences . Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13 . A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child 's mother and grandmother . Munden , formerly of Marchwood , near Southampton , denied the offence , claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court . During the sentencing David Jenkins , prosecuting , told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children .

Mr Jenkins said children 's clothes , books and dolls were found at Munden 's home and added : 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls .

        "source": "( CNN ) The classic video game `` Space Invaders '' was developed in Japan back in the late 1970 's -- and now their real-life counterparts are the topic of an earnest political discussion in Japan 's corridors of power . Luckily , Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government 's top military official earnestly revealed that the country 's Air Self Defense Force ( ASDF ) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object . Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki , Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet , Japan 's parliament , that his jets had , to date , never come across any UFOs from outer space . `` When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country 's airspace , it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation , '' Nakatani said . He continued : `` They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I do n't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth . '' Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as `` among the most respected men in sports-entertainment '' -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization . He entered Japan 's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013 . He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976 , in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches , which would later pave the way for today 's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests . Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products , from hot sauce to banks . The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages , and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman 's `` basketball diplomacy '' by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea . He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s , although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism . The lawmaker , who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements , had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats , and if research was being done into alien visitors , prompting Nakatani 's response .

Luckily , Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government 's top military official earnestly revealed that the country 's Air Self Defense Force ( ASDF ) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object . Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki , Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet , Japan 's parliament , that his jets had , to date , never come across any UFOs from outer space . `` When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country 's airspace , it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation , '' Nakatani said . He continued : `` They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I do n't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth . '' Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as `` among the most respected men in sports-entertainment '' -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization . He entered Japan 's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013 . He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976 , in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches , which would later pave the way for today 's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests . Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products , from hot sauce to banks . The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages , and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman 's `` basketball diplomacy '' by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea . He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s , although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism . The lawmaker , who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements , had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats , and if research was being done into alien visitors , prompting Nakatani 's response . Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes , but admitted that he did n't know personally if aliens existed . The exchange was n't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet . In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications , under Japan 's pacifist constitution , of a defense against an invasion from outer space .

        "source": "Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers , a large-scale study has found . The researchers said say that just as antibiotics are used to make farm animals put on weight , the may also be fattening our children . Writing in the respected medical journal Pediatrics , they said that the widely-prescribed drugs could be contributing to the obesity epidemic . A third of 10-11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4-5 year olds in England are overweight or obese , leading to fears that today 's generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than their parents . Obesity : Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers , a large-scale study has found ( file photo ) The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription . By two years-old , one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese . And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight . Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler . Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics . They were also slightly taller than boys who had n't been given the drugs . The study did n't prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain . But if they do , it may be because they kill of bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten . This frees up more food for the body . Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite . Lead author Dr Antti Saari , of Kuopio University Hospital , warned : 'Antibiotic exposure before six months of age , or repeatedly during infancy , was associated with increased body mass in healthy children . 'Such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy . The worldwide obesity epidemic is real , and is more pronounced for boys . 'Epidemic ' : By two years-old , one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese and children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight ( file photo ) 'An increase in the use of antibiotics could be an additional contributing factor to the development of excess weight problems . 'The crucial role of antibiotics in the improvement of human health is unquestionable but their extended use today has undesirable and unexpected consequences . ' Previous research has found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems . The studies come amid growing concern that the over-prescription of antibiotics is leading to the pills losing their power and making common infections harder to treat . The Government has warned that a new superbug could infect up to 200,000 Britons and kill 80,000 in a single outbreak .",

The researchers said say that just as antibiotics are used to make farm animals put on weight , the may also be fattening our children . Writing in the respected medical journal Pediatrics , they said that the widely-prescribed drugs could be contributing to the obesity epidemic . A third of 10-11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4-5 year olds in England are overweight or obese , leading to fears that today 's generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than their parents . Obesity : Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers , a large-scale study has found ( file photo ) The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription . By two years-old , one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese . And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight . Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler . Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics . They were also slightly taller than boys who had n't been given the drugs . The study did n't prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain . But if they do , it may be because they kill of bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten . This frees up more food for the body . Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite . Lead author Dr Antti Saari , of Kuopio University Hospital , warned : 'Antibiotic exposure before six months of age , or repeatedly during infancy , was associated with increased body mass in healthy children . 'Such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy . The worldwide obesity epidemic is real , and is more pronounced for boys . 'Epidemic ' : By two years-old , one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese and children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight ( file photo ) 'An increase in the use of antibiotics could be an additional contributing factor to the development of excess weight problems . 'The crucial role of antibiotics in the improvement of human health is unquestionable but their extended use today has undesirable and unexpected consequences . ' Previous research has found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems . The studies come amid growing concern that the over-prescription of antibiotics is leading to the pills losing their power and making common infections harder to treat . The Government has warned that a new superbug could infect up to 200,000 Britons and kill 80,000 in a single outbreak .\n\nSummary: \n\nBabies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers . A third of 10-11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4-5 year olds in england are overweight or obese .\n\n\nEvaluation Form (scores ONLY):\n\n- Consistency:",

        "source": "( CNN ) SpaceX on Tuesday launched a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon on a flight from Cape Canaveral , Florida , to the International Space Station . That was the easy part . In a difficult bid to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time , the private space exploration company was unsuccessful . SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted : `` Ascent successful . Dragon enroute to Space Station . Rocket landed on droneship , but too hard for survival . '' He later clarified that the rocket landed , but tipped over . SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January , but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded . SpaceX has said it will keep trying and , after it masters landing at sea , hopes to someday land rockets on the ground . Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth 's atmosphere or , like NASA 's space shuttle boosters , they fall back into the ocean . So why try to land one ? Musk wants to cut costs . On his company 's website , he says that if anyone can figure out how to `` reuse rockets just like airplanes , the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred . '' What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon ? The smaller , top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth 's atmosphere . The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds ( 1,950 kilograms ) of supplies , including research equipment and ISSpresso , an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea . The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon . They 'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments , trash and other stuff to send back to Earth . When they 're done , Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California . This is the sixth SpaceX mission to the International Space Station . The company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station . Tuesday 's launch was the second attempt for this mission . Monday 's planned launch was scrubbed due to weather . CNN 's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report .",

That was the easy part . In a difficult bid to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time , the private space exploration company was unsuccessful . SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted : `` Ascent successful . Dragon enroute to Space Station . Rocket landed on droneship , but too hard for survival . '' He later clarified that the rocket landed , but tipped over . SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January , but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded . SpaceX has said it will keep trying and , after it masters landing at sea , hopes to someday land rockets on the ground . Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth 's atmosphere or , like NASA 's space shuttle boosters , they fall back into the ocean . So why try to land one ? Musk wants to cut costs . On his company 's website , he says that if anyone can figure out how to `` reuse rockets just like airplanes , the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred . '' What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon ? The smaller , top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth 's atmosphere . The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds ( 1,950 kilograms ) of supplies , including research equipment and ISSpresso , an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea . The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon . They 'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments , trash and other stuff to send back to Earth . When they 're done , Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California . This is the sixth SpaceX mission to the International Space Station . The company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station . Tuesday 's launch was the second attempt for this mission . Monday 's planned launch was scrubbed due to weather . CNN 's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report .\n\nSummary: \n\nSpacex on falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called dragon . Spacex has said it will keep trying to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time .

        "source": "First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby ' . Kits aside , this was probably as far removed from Sunday 's big match as you could imagine . For a start , no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English . Of those , 10 were Mancunian . Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick Ticket prices ? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen . Altrincham 's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford , but it does have a proud history of its own . It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United 's Carrington complex , where Paul McGuinness 's Under 18s usually ply their trade . The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors . And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team . In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood , from just down the road in Sale , came closest for City with an audacious chip . United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby ' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford , another local lad from whom big things are expected , wasted two decent opportunities when put through . Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first . In March , the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players . He was at it again here , showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul . After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal .

Kits aside , this was probably as far removed from Sunday 's big match as you could imagine . For a start , no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English . Of those , 10 were Mancunian . Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick Ticket prices ? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen . Altrincham 's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford , but it does have a proud history of its own . It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United 's Carrington complex , where Paul McGuinness 's Under 18s usually ply their trade . The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors . And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team . In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood , from just down the road in Sale , came closest for City with an audacious chip . United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby ' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford , another local lad from whom big things are expected , wasted two decent opportunities when put through . Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first . In March , the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players . He was at it again here , showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul . After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal . Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson 's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post . The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser .

        "source": "There would have been no mercy in the dressing room . Nothing is sacred in the team . When Ben Stokes first turned up at the Kensington Oval this week someone would have said : \u2018 Mind that locker , Stokesey. \u2019 It was here , of course , that Stokes broke his wrist punching a locker after being dismissed last year and that will be a reminder to him of the need to channel his aggression in the right way now he is back in the England team . Ben Stokes has forged a reputation as a fiery character in the England cricket team Stokes ( left ) clashed with Marlon Samuels during the second Test between West Indies and England But Stokes ( right ) responded positively to the row after talking to England coach Peter Moores Only a slight niggle in his back might stop Stokes playing here in Barbados and I am glad he has fought his way back after what has been a year of ups and downs . I like Stokes and I like his character at a time when the game can be perceived as producing robots and players who can not capture the imagination . He has something about him , as he showed when he was in Mitchell Johnson \u2019 s face during the Ashes series . He was not worried about the bombardment he would get in return . But I do believe he will need careful man-managing . Peter Moores , England \u2019 s coach , dragged him to one side after his clash with Marlon Samuels in the second Test and had a long chat with him and if it was to talk about how he should respond then the advice he gave was clearly right . The way he approached the Jamaican after that third-day salute was spot on . England must make sure they do not quash that natural exuberance and desire to take someone on . It will not always come off but we have to accept that there will be lows as well as highs with this lad . What Stokes must not do is try to live up to his reputation and become pigeon-holed . He can be feisty and fiery as long as it \u2019 s natural but his aggression has to be controlled . You want the character as long as the end product is runs and wickets . Stokes ( second left ) can use his aggression to bring runs and wickets to the England team Stokes ( left ) congratulates England captain Alastair Cook after the side won the second Test England want to have Stokes in the team as much as possible to help him hit his full potential Let him go a bit but rein him in occasionally . There is an argument here to play the second spinner in Adil Rashid and if England went down that route in Bridgetown the place of Stokes or Chris Jordan would come into question but they clearly want both to play as much as possible . This summer there will rarely be the need for two spinners so England want these two exciting cricketers to grow into the international game . They can only get better and that \u2019 s an exciting prospect .",

When Ben Stokes first turned up at the Kensington Oval this week someone would have said : \u2018 Mind that locker , Stokesey. \u2019 It was here , of course , that Stokes broke his wrist punching a locker after being dismissed last year and that will be a reminder to him of the need to channel his aggression in the right way now he is back in the England team . Ben Stokes has forged a reputation as a fiery character in the England cricket team Stokes ( left ) clashed with Marlon Samuels during the second Test between West Indies and England But Stokes ( right ) responded positively to the row after talking to England coach Peter Moores Only a slight niggle in his back might stop Stokes playing here in Barbados and I am glad he has fought his way back after what has been a year of ups and downs . I like Stokes and I like his character at a time when the game can be perceived as producing robots and players who can not capture the imagination . He has something about him , as he showed when he was in Mitchell Johnson \u2019 s face during the Ashes series . He was not worried about the bombardment he would get in return . But I do believe he will need careful man-managing . Peter Moores , England \u2019 s coach , dragged him to one side after his clash with Marlon Samuels in the second Test and had a long chat with him and if it was to talk about how he should respond then the advice he gave was clearly right . The way he approached the Jamaican after that third-day salute was spot on . England must make sure they do not quash that natural exuberance and desire to take someone on . It will not always come off but we have to accept that there will be lows as well as highs with this lad . What Stokes must not do is try to live up to his reputation and become pigeon-holed . He can be feisty and fiery as long as it \u2019 s natural but his aggression has to be controlled . You want the character as long as the end product is runs and wickets . Stokes ( second left ) can use his aggression to bring runs and wickets to the England team Stokes ( left ) congratulates England captain Alastair Cook after the side won the second Test England want to have Stokes in the team as much as possible to help him hit his full potential Let him go a bit but rein him in occasionally . There is an argument here to play the second spinner in Adil Rashid and if England went down that route in Bridgetown the place of Stokes or Chris Jordan would come into question but they clearly want both to play as much as possible . This summer there will rarely be the need for two spinners so England want these two exciting cricketers to grow into the international game . They can only get better and that \u2019 s an exciting prospect .\n\nSummary: \n\nBen stokes first turned up at the kensington oval this week . Stokes broke his wrist punching a locker after being dismissed last year . Stokes has forged a reputation as a fiery character in the england cricket team . Stokes clashed with marlon samuels during the second test between west indies and england .\n\n\nEvaluation Form (scores ONLY):\n\n- Consistency:",

Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl . A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit . Stephen Munden , 54 , ( pictured with and without a beard ) was last seen leaving a hospital , near Hook , Hampshire He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall , of a heavy build , and has dark hair . Officers said they believed that Munden , who suffers from learning difficulties , may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave . He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences . Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13 . A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child 's mother and grandmother . Munden , formerly of Marchwood , near Southampton , denied the offence , claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court .

World No 1 Williams eventually prevailed 4-6 7-6 ( 3 ) 6-3 against the dogged Italian to take her career record over her to 8-0 but the American was not impressed . The US were beaten 3-2 as Williams and Alison Riske were thrashed 6-0 6-3 in the doubles rubber by Errani and Flavia Pennetta , meaning they were relegated to World Group II . American tennis star Serena Williams fought back to beat Italian Sara Errani in the Fed Cup play-off on Sunday Tough weather conditions made it difficult for both players who had to keep on re-tossing their serves Errani gave Williams a real scare but in the end the world No 1 's power proved to be too much 'Today has been a big eye opener , ' Williams said afterwards . ' I 'm totally not as ready for the claycourt season as I thought I was . Now I 'm in the mindset of , `` You know what , I 'm not on hard court . '' I 'm playing like I 'm on hard court and I 'm not . 'So I have to play and be ready to hit a thousand shots if necessary . ' Williams , 33 , won her 19th singles grand slam at the Australian Open and her dominance has raised talk of her claiming all the majors this year . The French Open has been her least successful of the four though despite claiming the title in Paris in 2002 and 2013 . Her doubles defeat on Sunday blotted an otherwise flawless Fed Cup record and left the US facing a battle to get back amongst the elite nations next year . 'We have to work harder , ' US captain Mary Joe Fernandez said . 'We came close today and need to just keep plugging away . 'The good news is that we have a lot of players in the top 100 and , hopefully , we can get two wins next year and get back into the World Group .

World No 1 Williams eventually prevailed 4-6 7-6 ( 3 ) 6-3 against the dogged Italian to take her career record over her to 8-0 but the American was not impressed . The US were beaten 3-2 as Williams and Alison Riske were thrashed 6-0 6-3 in the doubles rubber by Errani and Flavia Pennetta , meaning they were relegated to World Group II . American tennis star Serena Williams fought back to beat Italian Sara Errani in the Fed Cup play-off on Sunday Tough weather conditions made it difficult for both players who had to keep on re-tossing their serves Errani gave Williams a real scare but in the end the world No 1 's power proved to be too much 'Today has been a big eye opener , ' Williams said afterwards . ' I 'm totally not as ready for the claycourt season as I thought I was . Now I 'm in the mindset of , `` You know what , I 'm not on hard court . '' I 'm playing like I 'm on hard court and I 'm not . 'So I have to play and be ready to hit a thousand shots if necessary . ' Williams , 33 , won her 19th singles grand slam at the Australian Open and her dominance has raised talk of her claiming all the majors this year . The French Open has been her least successful of the four though despite claiming the title in Paris in 2002 and 2013 . Her doubles defeat on Sunday blotted an otherwise flawless Fed Cup record and left the US facing a battle to get back amongst the elite nations next year . 'We have to work harder , ' US captain Mary Joe Fernandez said . 'We came close today and need to just keep plugging away . 'The good news is that we have a lot of players in the top 100 and , hopefully , we can get two wins next year and get back into the World Group . ' Williams congratulates Italy captain Corrado Barazzutti after competing in America 's doubles defeat\n\nSummary: \n\nSerena williams beat sara errani 4-6 7-6 ( 3 ) in the fed cup . The claycourt season gets into full swing . World no 1 williams defeated sara errani in the semi-finals . The american tennis star is to beat the italian sara errani .\n\n\nEvaluation Form (scores ONLY):\n\n- Consistency:",

Roma full back Jose Holebas tracks Napoli midfielder Jose Callejon as Roma finally won at home Iburte skips past Miguel Britoss during a vital win for Roma , who have fallen off the pace recently Napoli may have had a case for a penalty when Kostas Manolas stopped Jonathan De Guzman in the 39th with shoulder contact but there was n't much of a protest to referee Nicola Rizzoli , who officiated last year 's World Cup final . In the second half , De Sanctis was superb in denying Dries Mertens on several occasions . The 38-year-old goalkeeper also made a leaping save on a shot from Manolo Gabbiadini in the 64th . Iturbe had a chance to make it 2-0 two minutes from time but hit the outside of the net . Napoli forward Lorenzo Insigne came on late for his first action since tearing his knee in November .\n\nSummary: \n\nRoma ended their four-month winless streak at home with a victory over Napoli in Serie A on Saturday in a key match for Champions League places . Miralem Pjanic finished off a swift counter-attack for Roma in the 25th minute . Second-place Roma moved provisionally four points ahead of city rivals Lazio .\n\n\nEvaluation Form (scores ONLY):\n\n- Consistency:",

Stephen Munden , 54 , described as having a 'fanatical obsession ' with small girls after he targeted a toddler on a bus , has been missing since 6.15pm on Tuesday and was last seen leaving a hospital , near Hook , Hampshire . Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl . A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit . Stephen Munden , 54 , ( pictured with and without a beard ) was last seen leaving a hospital , near Hook , Hampshire He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall , of a heavy build , and has dark hair . Officers said they believed that Munden , who suffers from learning difficulties , may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave . He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences . Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13 . A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child 's mother and grandmother . Munden , formerly of Marchwood , near Southampton , denied the offence , claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court . During the sentencing David Jenkins , prosecuting , told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children . The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images . Mr Jenkins said children 's clothes , books and dolls were found at Munden 's home and added : 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls . ' A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child 's mother and grandmother . Munden , formerly of Marchwood , near Southampton , denied the offence , claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court Consultant physiatrist John O'Shea said the defendant was autistic and also suffered from mild learning difficulties . He added that Munden had difficulty controlling his sexual interest in small children but the girl on the bus was probably unaware of his intentions . Keely Harvey , in mitigation , said : 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child 's hand . ' But the judge said 'the move from non-contact offences to a contact offence is significant ' and he was made the subject of a hospital order .

        "source": "Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has been handed the backing of five former England managers as he bids to push through radical changes . Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12 , however he is facing opposition from the Premier League . The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown ' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21 . FA chairman Greg Dyke ( left ) , speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore , wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs Graham Taylor , Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke , the Daily Telegraph reports . According to the newspaper , the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA 's England Commission . 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible , ' the letter reportedly says . It adds : 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup . ' Former England managers ( clockwise ) Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Steve McClaren and Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke 's call Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent . The managers add : 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility . 'However , as the England Commission 's evidence has demonstrated , the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it 's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager . ' The rise of Harry Kane ( centre ) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result , and Roy Hodgson 's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date , winning all five of their matches . There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players , the former England bosses reason . 'With promising players such as ( Ross ) Barkley , ( Raheem ) Sterling and ( Harry ) Kane starting to break through , it is clear we can still produce top young talent , ' they write . 'The one thing they are not being offered is the most important of all : opportunity . '",

Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12 , however he is facing opposition from the Premier League . The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown ' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21 . FA chairman Greg Dyke ( left ) , speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore , wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs Graham Taylor , Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke , the Daily Telegraph reports . According to the newspaper , the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA 's England Commission . 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible , ' the letter reportedly says . It adds : 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup . ' Former England managers ( clockwise ) Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Steve McClaren and Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke 's call Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent . The managers add : 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility . 'However , as the England Commission 's evidence has demonstrated , the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it 's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager . ' The rise of Harry Kane ( centre ) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result , and Roy Hodgson 's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date , winning all five of their matches . There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players , the former England bosses reason . 'With promising players such as ( Ross ) Barkley , ( Raheem ) Sterling and ( Harry ) Kane starting to break through , it is clear we can still produce top young talent , ' they write . 'The one thing they are not being offered is the most important of all : opportunity . '\n\nSummary: \n\nFa chairman greg dyke wants to increase minimum number of homegrown players in club squads from eight to 12 .

Stephen Munden , 54 , described as having a 'fanatical obsession ' with small girls after he targeted a toddler on a bus , has been missing since 6.15pm on Tuesday and was last seen leaving a hospital , near Hook , Hampshire . Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl . A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit . Stephen Munden , 54 , ( pictured with and without a beard ) was last seen leaving a hospital , near Hook , Hampshire He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall , of a heavy build , and has dark hair . Officers said they believed that Munden , who suffers from learning difficulties , may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave . He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences . Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13 . A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child 's mother and grandmother . Munden , formerly of Marchwood , near Southampton , denied the offence , claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court . During the sentencing David Jenkins , prosecuting , told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children . The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images . Mr Jenkins said children 's clothes , books and dolls were found at Munden 's home and added : 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls .

Munden , formerly of Marchwood , near Southampton , denied the offence , claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court Consultant physiatrist John O'Shea said the defendant was autistic and also suffered from mild learning difficulties . He added that Munden had difficulty controlling his sexual interest in small children but the girl on the bus was probably unaware of his intentions . Keely Harvey , in mitigation , said : 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child 's hand . ' But the judge said 'the move from non-contact offences to a contact offence is significant ' and he was made the subject of a hospital order .
